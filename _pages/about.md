I am a researcher working in the exciting field of quantum information.
In my work I focus on **quantum error correction**, i.e., making sure that quantum computers function correctly even when some of their components go wrong.
This research is crucial in the quest to build large-scale quantum computers and also has surprising connections to various fields of mathematics, physics, and computer science.

I completed my PhD at University College London under the supervision of [Dan Browne](https://sites.google.com/site/danbrowneucl).
Subsequently, I held a joint postdoctoral fellowship at the [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) and the [Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC)](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing), where my mentors were [Raymond Laflamme](https://laflamme.iqc.uwaterloo.ca) and [Daniel Gottesman](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dgottesm/).
Most recently, I worked as a Senior Quantum Architecture Scientist at [Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc.](https://xanadu.ai) and as a Research Scientist at the Perimeter Institute.
Currently, I am a visiting fellow at the Perimeter Institute and an associate member of IQC.
