### Current students

- **Miya Dridi**. PhD student at Inria Paris and Télécom Paris jointly supervised by me, Patrick Cheinet and [Paul Hilaire](https://paulhilaire.github.io).
- **Etienne Stock**. Master's student at Inria Paris and TU Munich jointly supervised by me, Lucas Berent and [Robert Wille](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/team/wille/).
- **Ewan Murphy**. PhD student at Inria Paris and Quandela jointly supervised by me, Boris Bourdoncle and [Anthony Leverrier](https://sites.google.com/site/anthonyleverrier).

### Former students

- **Emiliia Dyrenkova**. I supervised Emiliia's master's thesis on fermionic encodings (alongside Raymond Laflamme). Emiliia is currently studying for a PhD in quantum computing at the University of Toronto.
- [Eric Huang](https://www.quics.umd.edu/people/eric-huang). I supervised Eric's PSI essay for the Perimeter Scholars International master's program (alongside Beni Yoshida). Eric is currently studying for a PhD in quantum error correction and fault tolerance at the University of Maryland.

### Former interns

- **S. Siddardha Chelluri**. I supervised Siddhu for a summer residency project on fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing at Xanadu (alongside Ilan Tzitrin). Siddhu now works for [Welinq](https://www.welinq.fr).
- **Praveen Jayakumar**. I supervised Praveen for a summer residency project on improving decoder performance at Xanadu (alongside Priya Nadkarni). Praveen is currently studying for a PhD in quantum chemistry a the University of Toronto.
- **Daniel Honciuc Menendez**. I supervised Daniel for a summer project on implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates at Perimeter Institute. Daniel is currently studying for an MSc in physics with quantum dynamics at Imperial College London.
